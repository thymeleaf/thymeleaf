# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Thank you for your collaboration keeping Thymeleaf safe and secure. If you believe you have found a security
issue in Thymeleaf, please notify us so that we can work with you in its prompt resolution.

### Disclosure Policy

* Let us know as soon as possible by sending an email to [security@thymeleaf.org](mailto:security@thymeleaf.org).
* Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a
  third-party. Especially, **do not** create a GitHub issue ticket yourself talking about the
  vulnerability. We may publicly disclose the issue _before_ resolving it, but only if appropriate.

### Credit

We will credit the reporter of a confirmed vulnerability in the GitHub ticket created for publishing it (typically
once it is fixed).

### Exclusions

We reserve the right to consider out of the scope of Thymeleaf's security:

* Developer bad practices and inadequate uses of Thymeleaf that effectively _create_ the vulnerability in
  the applications being developed with Thymeleaf.
* Attacks requiring physical access to the machine Thymeleaf is running on.
* Issues in Thymeleaf's software dependencies which can be reported to these dependencies' maintainers.


## Supported Versions

  * 3.1.x is the current development line. This version is **not** recommended for production use yet.
  * 3.0.x is the latest production line (GA as of May 2016) and is under active support.
  * 2.1.x and previous versions are no longer supported. No further maintenance
    and security patches are planned in those lines.

At this point, we recommend upgrading to the latest Thymeleaf 3.0.x release.
