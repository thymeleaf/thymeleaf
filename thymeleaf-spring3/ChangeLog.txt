3.0.4
=====
- Improved startup times at the template engine by means of lazy initialization of dialect artifacts.


3.0.3
=====
- Improved JavaDoc API.


3.0.2
=====
- Fixed ThymeleafView not having public constructors, which made separate definition
  of View beans impossible.
- Improved handling of View beans by ThymeleafViewResolver so that beans with scope
  prototype of class ThymeleafView can now be properly used.


3.0.1
=====
- Fixed registered custom editor not used for nested property path with double-brace syntax.


3.0.0
=====
See: http://forum.thymeleaf.org/Thymeleaf-3-0-is-here-td4029676.html

2.1.4
=====
- Fixed th:errorclass not picking the correct form property name when selected object expression
  has more than one level.
- Fixed bad selection of th:field processor when the "type" attribute is computed in runtime.
- Fixed NotReadablePropertyException on conversion service called on bound bean's method
  instead of property.
- Set ApplicationContext to RedirectViews so that RequestDataValueProcessor can modify the
  URLs to which the application redirects.
- Modified behavuour at ThymeleafViewResolver so that a non-View registered bean cannot be
  accidentally picked for prototyping a view object.zx
- Made data Spring format/conversion not apply for inputs with type 'number' or 'range' to
  avoid browsers being unable to parse data because of format (e.g. percents).
- Improved MANIFEST jar metadata.
- Updated dependencies (slf4j 1.6.1 -> 1.6.6)


2.1.3
=====
- Added MapAccessor to ThymeleafEvaluationContext in order to allow dot syntax accessing map
  context variables in expressions: ${oneMap.oneKey}
- Enhanced delegation of the execution of Spring EL expressions into Spring's own infrastructure
  fixing, among other scenarios, the correct conversion of iterated objects.


2.1.2
=====
- Disabled integration with RequestDataValueProcessor when Spring version is >= 4.x in order to
  avoid exceptions (due to interface changes between spring 3.2 and 4.0).
- Fixed marker hidden inputs being added for checkboxes and multiple selects even when they are
  disabled (provoking undesired deletion of attribute values).


2.1.1
=====
- Fixed incorrect Spring object binding of single-level (no x.y field) expressions, resulting in
  ConversionService not being applied on certain scenarios.


2.1.0 (from 2.0.19)
===================
(See What's New in Thymeleaf 2.1 at http://www.thymeleaf.org/whatsnew21.html)
- New Feature: More integrated acccess to beans from expressions
- New Feature: Integration of Spring type conversion infrastructure
- New Feature: Spring-resource based template resolver
- New Feature: Render view fragments directly from controllers
- New Feature: New th:errorclass for adding CSS class to form fields in error
- New Feature: Additional form validation error reporting options
- New Feature: Transparent integration with Spring's RequestDataValueProcessor


2.0.19
======
- Applied annotation-based autowiring to custom Thymeleaf View classes even when they were not declared as a bean
  at the application context.
- Implemented size() and isEmpty() in "beans" map in context variables.


2.0.18
======
- (No changes)


2.0.17
======
- Added a "#themes.code('key')" expression object which looks up and returns the value of
  'key' in the current Spring theme's properties file.  This is the equivalent of Spring's
  <spring:theme code='key'> JSP tag.
- Fixed <input> tags with no "type" attribute not being treated as type="text" (which they should).
- Fixed form error messages output with th:errors not being escaped and provoking a parsing error
  if they contained <, >, &, etc.


2.0.16
======
- Automatically add @PathVariable's to model when using Spring 3.1 or newer. 
- Forbidden the inclusion of request parameter variables ('param.*') in preprocessing expressions
  and th:utext attribute values.


2.0.15
======
- Made "beans" context variable not override a variable with the same name, if such variable comes
  from the model.
- Fixed: Added "SpringTemplateEngine.setTemplateEngineMessageSource(...)" for letting users really 
  specify a MessageSource to be used by thymeleaf overriding the one automatically set by Spring.


2.0.14
======
- Refactored SpelEvaluationContext to act as a decorator (requirement for thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity3).


2.0.13
======
- (No changes)


2.0.12
======
- Fixed "viewClass" property in ThymeleafViewResolver requiring an implementation of
  ThymeleafView instead of AbstractThymeleafView.
- Added AjaxEnabledView interface for views that include an "ajaxHandler" property.


2.0.11
======
- Add "getFragmentSpec()" / "setFragmentSpec(IFragmentSpec)" methods to ThymeleafView in order to 
  allow the processing of "partial" views (only the template fragments selected by the IFragmentSpec 
  will be processed and rendered).
- Add AJAX-enabled AjaxThymeleafViewResolver and AjaxThymeleafView, making use of an AjaxHandler 
  instance from Spring JS (part of Spring Webflow).
- Add AJAX-enabled FlowAjaxThymeleafView, for Spring WebFlow integration.


2.0.10
======
- (No changes)


2.0.9
=====
- Added RequestContext variable to Model as AbstractTemplateView.SPRING_MACRO_REQUEST_CONTEXT_ATTRIBUTE
  besides thymeleaf's own SpringContextVariableNames.SPRING_REQUEST_CONTEXT for better compatibility
  with other view-layer technologies.
- Added an HttpServletResponse parameter to SpringWebContext constructors in order to be able to access
  response from processors.
- Refactored SpringEL expression evaluation.
- Added "viewClass" property to ThymeleafViewResolver.


2.0.8
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.7
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.6
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.5
=====
- Modified ViewResolver so that view beans are only configured using an existing bean as prototype
  if this bean is of type ThymeleafView.
- Made ThymeleafView return the default content type in getContentType() even if setContentType()
  has not been called before. This allows compatibility with the ContentNegotiatingViewResolver
  view resolver appeared in Spring 3.0.
- Improved javadoc for ThymeleafViewResolver and ThymeleafView.


2.0.4
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.3
=====
- Modified behaviour of th:method in <form> tags so that it controls whether the selected method
  is supported by browsers (get, post) or not. If not, it creates a hidden input field inside the
  form (named '_method') with the original value and sets the method to 'post'. This mirrors the
  behaviour of Spring's FormTag class (Spring taglib's "<form:form>" tag).
- Added "excludedViewNames" property to ThymeleafViewResolver so that a set of patterns of views
  that will not be resolved by this ViewResolver can be specified. This will act as an 'exclusions'
  filter for what is specified at the "viewNames" property.


2.0.2
=====
- (No changes)


2.0.1
=====
- Fixed incorrect exception messages.


2.0.0
=====
- Created version "3" of the standard DTDs for XHTML template validation, including the
  new th:switch and th:case attributes. 
- Adapted processors to the new DOM/IProcessor infrastructure.


1.1.4
=====
- Solved bug regarding evaluation of the same SpEL expression two times over two objects
  of different classes. Spring AST infrastructure was caching PropertyAccessors and this
  caused ClassCastExceptions. This error appeared on 1.1.3 because of the introduction of
  SpEL expression caching.
  

1.1.3
=====
- Modified SpringWebContext constructors so that they require now the ServletContex 
  object. This enables Thymeleaf to operate without depending at all
  on creating an HTTP session object for the user executing the template.
- Created cache for SpEL evaluation and optimized use of SpEL contexts.


1.1.2
=====
- Fixed: potential case-sensitivity problem in select tags.
- Fixed: bad initialization of th:field on option tags contained within <optgroup>


1.1.1
=====
- Fixed: avoid non-minimizable tags like <script>, <textarea>, <div>, etc. to be
  minimized (appear as <script />, <textarea />, div /> without an end tag).


1.1.0
=====
- Deprecated IValueProcessor interface and related all infrastructure. 
- Created new versions (v2) of the set of thymeleaf-spring3-specific XHTML DTDs, including 
  the new "th:substituteby" attribute:
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-strict-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-transitional-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml1-frameset-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
    * http://www.thymeleaf.org/dtd/xhtml11-thymeleaf-spring3-2.dtd
