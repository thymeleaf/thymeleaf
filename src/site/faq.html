    <h2>About Thymeleaf</h2>

    <h3><a id="where-come-from">Where does Thymeleaf come from? Is it made or backed by any software company?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Thymeleaf is Open Source Software created in his spare time by a Spanish Software Engineer
      called <a href="team.html">Daniel Fernández</a>, who's also the author
      of other popular java libraries like <a href="http://www.jasypt.org">jasypt</a> or
      <a href="http://www.op4j.org">op4j</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is neither made nor backed
      by any software (or any other type of) company, and it is offered to the public
      totally free of charge, both in binary and in source code forms, under the <b>Apache License 2.0</b>.
    </p>


    <h3><a id="is-it-stable">Is it stable? Can it be considered production-ready?</a></h3>

    <p>
        Yes, all stable (non-beta) releases can be considered production-ready.
    </p>



    <h3><a id="does-offer-support">Does Thymeleaf offer any type of commercial support?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      No, it does not. Official commercial support is not offered at the moment, but
      there is a <a href="http://forum.thymeleaf.org">User Forum</a> at your disposal.
    </p>



    <h3><a id="who-is-using-thymeleaf">Who is using Thymeleaf?</a></h3>

    <p>
      Our '<a href="whoisusingthymeleaf.html">Who is using Thymeleaf?</a>' page
      contains a list of companies using Thymeleaf in their products, projects, websites, or even offering it as a part
      of their Professional Services portfolio. You will find some download figures there, too.
    </p>


    <h3><a id="versioning-policy">What is the project's versioning policy?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Thymeleaf version numbers have three components: <kbd>x.y.z</kbd> (like: <kbd>2.0.1</kbd>). 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><kbd>x</kbd> is the <b>major version number</b>. A change in this number means a rewrite
          of the core or architecture, or an important amount of changes in the library's APIs which
          might break backwards compatibility and/or legacy support.</li>
      <li><kbd>y</kbd> is the <b>minor version number</b>. A change in this number means a moderate
          set of changes has been applied, offering new features and improvements without changing
          APIs significantly and providing <i>deprecation</i> periods for all changed features in
          order to allow for a period of adaptation to the new interfaces.</li>
      <li><kbd>z</kbd> is the <b>build/bugfix version number</b>. A change in this number means
          the fix of some bugs or the addition of a series of performance or documentation
          improvements. <i>Bugfix versions</i> should modify no APIs and be therefore
          <i>drop-in</i> replacements for any previous version within the same major+minor version.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3><a id="how-can-i-contribute">How can I contribute to Thymeleaf?</a></h3>

    <p>
        The first and most useful way to contribute to the project is by helping other users
        at the <a href="http://forum.thymeleaf.org">forum</a> (or at other popular places like
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/thymeleaf">StackOverflow</a>,
        for instance). Building a better community is always priority number one.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also help Thymeleaf by promoting it: write on your blog, tweet, talk about it
        at your local JUG, or even simply discuss its advantages at your company/work and among your colleague
        developers. Help spread the word. Do you think your grandma might be interested? Tell her! :-)
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are already doing your best at helping users and promoting, and still you feel that you could do more,
        there are a couple of things that are always useful:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Help testing. No amount of testing is enough testing, and your experience as a user is extremely
            valuable for building useful tests that Thymeleaf's developers might never think of.
            Thymeleaf has its own <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-testing">testing library</a> and
            its own <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-tests">repository for
            tests</a>, and there's always room for contributions there. If you want suggestions about
            what to test, we can guide you towards the areas that might better benefit from your help.
        </li>
        <li>
            Help documenting. There's an "Articles" section at the <a href="documentation.html">documentation page</a>
            that always welcomes new articles, especially if they include a nice example application. Your name will
            be displayed as author at the article, so that you can add it to your resume ;), but of course
            we will ask you for a high level of quality and a good knowledge of the English language. We keep a list
            of topic suggestions <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf.github.com/issues">here</a>, but you
            can always propose your own to the Team.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        What else? Well, of course you can bring your own ideas! You can write in the <a href="http://forum.thymeleaf.org">User
        Forum</a>, create a <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf.github.com/issues">GitHub issue</a> or
        just send an email directly to the <a href="team.html">Team</a>. We will be happy to review and discuss your
        ideas with you.
        Please don't just upload a Pull Request with your favourite feature without previous discussion with the team
        &mdash; Thymeleaf is a complex project and requires a certain level of organization, and we might not be able
        to accept your code even if you put a lot of effort on it (or even if your idea is good!).
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, please note that <b>all artifact contributions to Thymelef (code, documentation...) are regulated
        by certain <a href="https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-dist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.markdown">Terms
        and Conditions</a></b>. Before accepting any patches, articles, etc. from you we will require you to
        explicitly agree on this terms (an email or a github comment will do).
    </p>


    <h3><a id="pronunciation">How do you pronounce 'thymeleaf'?</a></h3>

    <p>
        In case you are unsure, 'Thymeleaf' is pronounced like this:
        <strong>/&#x02c8;ta&#x026a;m&#x02cc;l&#x026a;&#x02d0;f/</strong>
    </p>


    <h2>General</h2>

    <h3><a id="is-web-framework">Is Thymeleaf a web framework?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      No, it isn't. It is a template engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Template engines play a key role in web frameworks, though, and are one of its most
      important components as they are in charge of producing the user interface or <i>view layer</i>
      (usually in XHTML or HTML form).
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Spring MVC</i>, <i>Struts</i> or <i>Apache Wicket</i> are examples of web frameworks, whereas
      <i>JSP</i>, <i>Velocity</i> or <i>FreeMarker</i> are examples of template engines.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="what-types-of-templates">What types of templates can Thymeleaf process?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Thymeleaf templates can be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>XML: validating against a DTD or not.</li>
      <li>XHTML 1.0 and 1.1: validating against standard DTDs or not.</li>
      <li>HTML5: both XML-formed code and <i>legacy-based HTML5</i>. Legacy non-XML code will be automatically
          cleaned and converted to XML form.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3><a id="substitute-jsp">Can Thymeleaf be used as a complete substitute for JSP and JSTL?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      <b>Absolutely</b>. Not only it can, but we strongly encourage you to do so. Have a look 
      at our <a href="thvsjsp.html">Thymeleaf vs. JSP</a> article if you want to learn
      how these two technologies compare.
    </p>
    
    <h3><a id="compare-other-engines">How does Thymeleaf compare with other template engines like Velocity or FreeMarker?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Both <i>Velocity</i> and <i>FreeMarker</i> are terrific pieces of software, but they approach the templating problem
      with a philosophy quite different to that of Thymeleaf.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Thymeleaf makes a strong stress on <i>natural templating</i> &mdash;allowing templates to be working 
      prototypes, which the other two do not allow&mdash;, and its syntax tries to be (arguably) cleaner and more in
      tune with the current trends in web development. Also, from an architectural standpoint, both <i>Velocity</i> and <i>FreeMarker</i> work as sequential text processors
      &mdash;which allows them to process many types of content&mdash; whereas Thymeleaf is based on XML parsing
      techniques &mdash;which limits it to XML-based formats. This makes <i>Velocity</i> and <i>FreeMarker</i>
      much more versatile, but on the other side allows Thymeleaf to take advantage of interesting features specific
      to XML-based environments, especially the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, the best way to compare these technologies is 
      to use them yourself and feel which one suits you best.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="can-it-non-web">Can it be used outside web applications in non-web environments?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Yes it can. Although Thymeleaf (especially its <i>Standard</i> dialects) offers many features
      that are especially useful in web environments, it can be used for processing non-web XML
      documents (data XML, for example) or XHTML/HTML5 documents that are not meant for being
      sent via HTTP (for example, rich email content).
    </p>

    <h3><a id="no-spring-can-I-use">I don't use Spring at all. Can I still use Thymeleaf?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      Absolutely. Thymeleaf offers nice integration with Spring MVC through its <i>SpringStandard</i>
      dialect (included in the <kbd>thymeleaf-spring3</kbd> and <kbd>thymeleaf-spring4</kbd> packages), but
      Spring integration is completely optional and the <i>Standard</i> dialect is in fact meant to be used
      without Spring.
    </p>

    <h3><a id="can-use-HTML5-XML">How can I use Thymeleaf for HTML5 if it is an XML-based technology?</a></h3>
    
    <p>
      You can because HTML5 allows non-XML-formed code only for legacy compatibility reasons, and HTML5 code
      can be (in fact, <i>should be</i>) well-formed XML.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Developers are encouraged to write new 
      HTML5 code as well-formed XML because this produces cleaner code, allows easy processing and
      parsing of code, and removes the need to rely on browsers' algorithms for automatically closing tags and
      converting code into fully hierarchical structures &mdash;something called <i>error handling</i> that
      browsers need to apply for representing web pages as DOM object trees. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And don't be fooled by the existence of a standard called <i>XHTML5</i>: that is exactly the same
      as HTML5, but served with the <kbd>application/xhtml+xml</kbd> HTTP Content-Type. There are no
      syntax differences like those ones existing between <i>HTML 4</i> and <i>XHTML 1.0</i>.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="fromhtmltohtmlviahtml.html">From HTML to HTML (via HTML)</a>.
    </p>


    <h3><a id="DOM-parsing-memory">Thymeleaf uses DOM-style parsing of XML. How does that affect memory usage?</a></h3>
    
    <p>    
      The use of DOM parsing makes Thymeleaf very well suited for web applications because web documents 
      are very often represented as object trees (in fact DOM trees are the way browsers represent 
      web pages in memory). Also, building on the idea that <i>most web applications use only a few 
      dozen templates</i>, that these are not big files and that they don't normally change while 
      the application is running, Thymeleaf's usage of an in-memory LRU cache of parsed template 
      DOMs allows it to be fast in production environments, because very little I/O is needed 
      (if any) for most template processing operations.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Of course, this architecture also requires the use of bigger amounts of memory space for 
      each template execution than other XML parsing/processing approaches (like for example SAX), 
      which means that you should not use the library for creating big <i>data XML documents</i> (as opposed 
      to <i>web documents</i>). As a general rule of thumb (and always depending on the memory size of your 
      JVM), if you are generating XML files with sizes around the tens of megabytes in a single 
      template execution, you should not be using Thymeleaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason <i>we consider this restriction only applies to data XML files and not web XHTML/HTML5</i> 
      is that you should never generate web documents so big that your users' browsers set ablaze and/or 
      explode – remember that these browsers will also have to create DOM trees for your pages!
    </p>    


    <h3><a id="use-snapshot">How can I use a SNAPSHOT release of Thymeleaf?</a></h3>
    
    <p>    
      From time to time, Thymeleaf will produce a <i>snapshot</i> release that will allow
      you to test new or being-developed features. These are <b>non production ready</b>
      releases, but will be stable enough for most testing purposes, and will enable you
      to try new features before they are generally available.
    </p> 
    <p>
      In order to use snapshot releases, you need to add the Sonatype OSS Snapshots
      repository in your Maven <kbd>pom.xml</kbd> file, like this:
    </p>
    
    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:xml;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        <repositories>
            <repository>
                <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
                <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>
                <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
                <snapshots>
                    <enabled>true</enabled>
                </snapshots>
            </repository>
        </repositories>
    ]]></script>
    
    <p>
      Also, you will have to modify your Thymeleaf dependency/ies to use a 
      <i>snapshot version</i>, which usually consists of the version number of the
      <b>next</b> release (not the current one), followed by <kbd>-SNAPSHOT</kbd>.
      For example, while <kbd>1.1.3</kbd> is the latest published stable release,
      snapshots will probably appear under the <kbd>1.1.4-SNAPSHOT</kbd> or
      maybe <kbd>1.2.0-SNAPSHOT</kbd> version numbers:
    </p>

    <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush:xml;gutter:false"><![CDATA[
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.thymeleaf</groupId>
            <artifactId>thymeleaf</artifactId>
            <version>1.1.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
            <scope>compile</scope>
        </dependency>
    ]]></script>


    <h3><a id="testing">How is thymeleaf tested?</a></h3>

    <p>
        Thymeleaf has its own testing framework, called <kbd>thymeleaf-testing</kbd>. This testing
        framework not only allows the Thymeleaf Team to easily test the library, but also allows users
        to test the view layer of their applications. You can explore it at
        <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-testing">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Making use of this testing framework, Thymeleaf maintains another GitHub repository completely devoted
        to tests. Tests, tests, and more tests. It's the <kbd>thymeleaf-tests</kbd> repository that you can find
        <a href="http://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-tests">here</a>. Want some figures? As of November 2013
        the <kbd>thymeleaf-tests</kbd> repository contained more than 1,200 test files, adding up to more than
        37,000 lines of testing code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides, we use
        <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> for continuous integration, thanks to what every release
        is published after being tested in no-Spring, Spring 3.0, Spring 3.1 and Spring 3.2 environments, with
        Java 6 and 7 (unfortunately Travis does not support Java 5, so we test that manually).
