Lagerwey designs and produces Direct Drive wind turbines 'in house' and offers an efficient and reliable product
in the multi megawatt range. We deliver our projects turn-key and provide a complete service and maintenance
package. Our flexible and transparent approach leads to long lasting relationships with our partners. Together
with our customers we have been offering the world clean and reliable wind energy since 1979.

Thymeleaf is used for developing a web portal for the Lagerwey customers, asset managers and service personnel.
Using this portal the Lagerwey wind turbines and wind farms can be monitored and controlled. Thanks to Thymeleaf
we are able to develop HTML5 pages displaying the wind turbines real time data.
