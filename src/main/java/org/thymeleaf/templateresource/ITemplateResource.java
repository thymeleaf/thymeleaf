/**
 * <p>
 *   Interface implemented by all <em>Template Resource</em> instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Template resources are created and returned by Template Resolvers
 *   ({@link org.thymeleaf.templateresolver.ITemplateResolver}) and represent the real resource
 *   that contains the template contents, but do not necessarily contain these contents themselves.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Most usually, template resources are used to obtain a {@link Reader} on the template contents,
 *   abstracting the real location of those contents.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Note that the existence of a template resource object does not imply the existence of the resource
 *   it represents. In order to check whether a resource really exists or not, the {@link #exists()} method
 *   can be called. Some implementations of {@link org.thymeleaf.templateresolver.ITemplateResolver} might
 *   in fact do so, but note that this can result in a loss of performance in some scenarios due to a double
 *   access to a resource that might be remote (an HTTP URL, for example): one access for checking existence,
 *   and another access for creating the {@link Reader} to be returned by {@link #reader()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Note that implementations of these interface might not be thread-safe.
 * </p>
