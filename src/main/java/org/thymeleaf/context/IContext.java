     * The problem of moving such controls to these context implementations is that these classes might
     * be user defined, and therefore such security controls bypassed by a careless implementation. Also, the
     * way these restrictions and controls has to be implemented is definitely expression-language-dependant,
     * so we are better off by using PropertyAccessors in OGNL and a Map wrapper in SpringEL.
