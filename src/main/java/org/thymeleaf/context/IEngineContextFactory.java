 *   Engine Contexts (implementations of {@link IEngineContext}) are the type of context really used by the engine

 * <p>
 *   The specific implementation of this interface to be used for template processing can be obtained and set at
 *   {@link org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine} instances by means of its
 *   {@link org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine#getEngineContextFactory()} and
 *   {@link org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine#setEngineContextFactory(IEngineContextFactory)} methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>

     * <p>
     *   Note this factory method will be only called once during the processing of a template. Once a engine context
     *   instance has been created, the engine will try to reuse it for any nested processing operations as far as
     *   possible. This means that, e.g., the <tt>templateData</tt> specified here will only be the <em>root-level</em>
     *   template data (the one for the template that is actually being used as an
     *   {@link org.thymeleaf.ITemplateEngine}<tt>.process(...)</tt> argument). Any <tt>th:insert</tt> or
     *   <tt>th:replace</tt> operations inside that template will not ask this factory to create a new engine context,
     *   but instead just increase the nesting level of the already-existing one
     *   (see {@link IEngineContext#increaseLevel()}) and set the new, nested template data for that level
     *   (see {@link IEngineContext#setTemplateData(TemplateData)}).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *   Note also that the <tt>context</tt> object passed here as an argument will normally correspond to the
     *   simple {@link IContext} implementation used for calling
     *   {@link org.thymeleaf.ITemplateEngine}<tt>.process(...)</tt> and, therefore, will normally be an object
     *   of class {@link EngineContext}, {@link WebContext} or similar.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param configuration the engine configuration being used.
     * @param templateData the {@link TemplateData} to be applied at level 0, i.e. the top-level template being processed.
     * @param templateResolutionAttributes the template resolution attributes specified for processing this template.
     * @param context the context, normally the one used for calling the Template Engine itself.
     * @return a new, freshly built engine context instance.
