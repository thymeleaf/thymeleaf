/**
 * <p>
 *   Interface to be implemented by context variables that need to be loaded lazily.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Variables implementing this interface have the opportunity to not be completely resolved at context build
 *   time, but instead wait until the variable is actually used in an expression executed from the template. This can
 *   importantly reduce the amount of memory required to store context variables per template in scenarios when
 *   many variables are made available to the templates in a generic manner (e.g. in frameworks that allow
 *   users to create their own templates), but templates might afterwards choose not to use some or many of these
 *   variables.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Note this <em>lazy resolution</em> can only be performed when the lazy variable is added to the context as a
 *   <strong>first-level</strong> variable. i.e. <tt>${lazy}</tt> will work, but <tt>${container.lazy}</tt>
 *   will not.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The {@link LazyContextVariable} abstract class contains a sensible implementation of this interface, best
 *   suited to be used for extension than the bare interface, in most cases.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the value being returned by this variable
