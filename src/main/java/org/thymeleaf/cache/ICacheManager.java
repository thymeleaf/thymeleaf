/**
 * <p>
 *   Common interface for all cache manager implementations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   This class is in charge of providing the corresponding cache objects to
 *   the template engine. Every call to each of the <tt>getXCache()</tt>
 *   methods must always return the XCache object (i.e. only one cache object
 *   should be ever created for each type of cache, and returned every time it
 *   is requested).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Four caches are predefined:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A <b>template cache</b>, used for storing parsed templates referenced
 *       by their <i>template name</i>.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>fragment cache</b>, used for storing the parsed DOM tree correspondence
 *       of <i>fragments</i>: pieces of template code that need to be parsed before being
 *       added to the template tree, like for example messages coming from
 *       <tt>.properties</tt> files with HTML tags that are included in results using
 *       <tt>th:utext</tt> processors.</li>
 *   <li>A <b>message cache</b>, used for storing messages (usually from internationalization
 *       files) referenced by template name and locale (like "home_gl_ES").</li>
 *   <li>An <b>expression cache</b>, used for storing expression evaluation artifacts
 *       (for example, {@link org.thymeleaf.standard.expression.Expression} parsed trees,
 *       OGNL/Spring EL parsed trees, etc). Given that this cache can usually store objects
 *       of different classes (referenced by their String representation), prefixes are
 *       normally applied to the String keys in order to being able to differentiate these
 *       differente classes when retrieving cache entries.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *   Only these four caches are needed by the template engine when the <i>standard</i> dialects
 *   are being used, but users might want to define new dialects and use new types of caches,
 *   which can be provided by the cache manager using the {@link #getSpecificCache(String)}
 *   method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   <b>Any of these methods could return null</b>, in which case the engine will consider that
 *   no cache must be applied for that specific function</b>.
 * </p>
